This is Hydra, a Ruby library for hyphenation patterns.

Work in progress.  At the moment: just make sure you have Ruby installed with
RSpec and byebug ([RVM](https://rvm.io/) is a nice tool to manage your Ruby
environments), and run `rspec` for the test suite; the individual test cases
are probably very obscure but documentation is forthcoming, I promise!

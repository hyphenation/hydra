This is Hydra, a Ruby library for hyphenation patterns.  Supports UTF-8 input
(actually, only UTF-8 at the moment).

Work in progress.  Very brief installation instructions: if you have a working
Ruby installation, type `bundle` in the top-level directory to install all
dependencies, and you should then be able to use `rspec` to run the test suite.
[RVM](https://rvm.io/) is a nice tool to manage your Ruby environments if you
can’t or don’t want to use Bundler with your system Ruby.
